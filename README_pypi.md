SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School) is a simulation platform for reinforcement learning and multi-agent research on autonomous driving. Its focus is on realistic and diverse interactions. It is part of the [XingTian](https://github.com/huawei-noah/xingtian/) suite of RL platforms from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.

Check out the paper at [SMARTS: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09776) for background on some of the project goals.
