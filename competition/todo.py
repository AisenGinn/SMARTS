# Things to ask.
# 1. The scales of score are different and cannot have a single overall score.
# 3. Different traffic rou.xml file is build each time. For evaluation, must fix the built rou.xml files
# to ensure same score for same models.
# 4. How should costs be affected if no overtake happens in overtake scenario? 


# To Do
# 2. Overtake detector
# 3. Traci Error
# 4. Codalab uploading
# 5. Cut-in scenario does not work
# 6. Retraining of model
