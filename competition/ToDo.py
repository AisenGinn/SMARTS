# To Inform/Ask.
# 1. The scales of score are different and cannot have a single overall score.
# 3. Different traffic rou.xml file is build each time. For evaluation, must fix the built rou.xml files
# to ensure same score for same models.
# 4. How should costs be affected if no overtake happens in overtake scenario? 
# 5. The lower the individual scores, the better it is. Each of the 4 metrics/costs need to be minimised.
# 6. A ReadMe is included for train and submission directories with instructions.
# 7. Preferably, we should just redirect participant to get the starter code from our github repository. 
# 8. Use requirements.txt to install dependencies for evaluation.

# To Do
# 2. Overtake detector
# 3. Traci Error
# 4. Codalab uploading
# 5. Cut-in scenario does not work
# 6. Retraining of model
