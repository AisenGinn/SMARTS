# Track-1

# Concerns

# Insignificant
# 1. Codalab disk space, time, and resources.

# 3. Replace Cut-in scenario from Patrick.
# 4. Remove Overtake detector according to Soheil's suggestion.
# 5. Check Distance to obstacles calculator according to Soheil's suggestion.
# 6. Try diversifying Overtake scenario.
