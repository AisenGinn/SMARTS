# For Track-1

# Concerns
# 1. Traci Error.
# 2. Review PR1487, test Codalab at secret url: https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/6015?secret_key=cbfc4754-73d9-4f11-80c5-997b2dbfb3de
# 3. Issue 1453 - Envision display : Incomplete JSONError lexical Error invalid char in json text

# ToDo
# 1. Steering and YawRate are None when using TargetPose action space. Cost function needs to be modified.
# 2. Merge deterministic scenario builds - PR1492.
# 3. Replace Cut-in scenario from Patrick.
# 4. Remove Overtake detector according to Soheil's suggestion.
# 5. Change distance to obstacles according to Soheil's suggestion.

# Minor
# 1. Can both tracks run concurrently and how to do it in Codalab.
# 2. How will TargetPose action space affect the scoring of steering rate.
# 3. Codalab disk space, time, and resources.
# 4. HTML rendering does not occur properly in Codalab competition description.
