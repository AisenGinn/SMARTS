<h1>ULTRA Competition</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
    Self-driving cars have been a hot topic in recent years, and is a thriving and
    booming research area holding the promise of a new generation in transportation
    development. Intending to further research in autonomous driving and in identifying
    rising stars, <strong>HUAWEI</strong> is hosting this competition using the
    open-source <strong>ULTRA</strong> platform.
</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<p>
    <strong>ULTRA</strong>, is an open-source Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
    autonomous driving built upon the&nbsp;<strong>SMARTS</strong> simulator. It
    provides a generalization benchmark for RL driving agents undergoing intersection
    navigation, specifically in unprotected left turns.
</p>

<p>ULTRA supports</p>
<ul>
<li>Building of customizable scenarios with different levels of difficulty</li>
<li>Analysis tools to evaluate traffic designs</li>
<li>Configurable train and test parameters</li>
<li>Baseline implementations of common RL algorithms</li>
<li>Benchmark results to train and test custom RL algorithms against</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>
    For training, your goal is to design an agent that is capable of driving safely and
    efficiently across a variety of simulated intersection maps. Competitors will create
    (and optionally train) a driverless car from scratch or from one of the provided
    baselines, that is capable of traversing multi-lane intersections both safely and
    efficiently. Success will require the creation and/or training of intelligent
    driving behaviours which allow for precise manipulation of the car's controls, and
    account for the behaviour of nearby vehicles.
</p>

<p>
    For evaluation, we are following a scoring metric that takes into account whether
    agent completed the left-turn, how fast the agent completed the left-turn, and also
    how safely the agent acted while completing the left-turn. We will evaluate your
    agent on hidden evaluation scenarios and determine a score for your agent
    submission. These hidden evaluation scenarios may range in the number of lanes, type
    of traffic density, seeding, and road speed. Though they differ in these aspects,
    they remain the same in the fact that all evaluation scenarios will be intersections
    that require your agent to undergo an unprotected left-turn. See the evaluation
    section for more information.
</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>
    Your challenge is to come up with an agent that can complete as many of the
    evaluation scenarios as quickly and as safely as it can. Your agent is allowed to
    use one of two observation types: either vector-based or image-based.
</p>

<p>
    This competition provides two different tracks: Track 1 and Track 2. Evaluation
    scenarios will differ depending on which track you have submitted your agent to.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Track 1 will evaluate your agent on its ability to complete an unprotected left-turn
    with no traffic. That is, your agent must learn how to drive and complete a
    left-turn, but does not have to worry about collisions with other vehicles.
</li>
<li>
    Track 2 is meant to push your agent to its limits. Like Track 1, Track 2 will
    evaluate your agent in unprotected left-turn scenarios, but this time with varying
    degrees of traffic in the intersection. That is, your agent must now not only be
    able to complete a left-turn, but it must also be mindful of neighboring vehicles
    and their movement.
</li>
</ul>
