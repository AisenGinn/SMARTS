<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>
    The starting kit provides a multitude of <strong>maps</strong> that can be used to
    generate unprotected left-turn scenarios to train and test your agent submission.
    The provided maps include different intersection types (cross-intersections and
    t-intersections), each with various speed limits (50 km/h, 70 km/h, and 100 km/h),
    and a diverse number of road lanes. These maps provide a road network on which
    <strong>scenarios</strong> can be built.
</p>

<p>
    Scenarios use these maps as a basis upon which to build more complex training data
    for your agent. Scenarios include the map that describes the road network, but also
    aspects such as the agent's mission and other vehicle traffic. See the starting kit
    for more details on how to build your own scenarios.
</p>

<p>In addition to building your own scenarios, you are also allowed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify your agent's reward function</li>
<li>Modify any code used for your agent</li>
<li>Build your agent off of any baseline in the starting kit</li>
<li>Change the maximum number of steps per episode your agent is allowed to take</li>
<li>Change the amount of time per timestep</li>
<li>Change the seeding of the environment and scenarios</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The only two requirements are that you use the continuous action space, and that
    your agent uses one of the two allowable observation spaces. If you have concerns
    about whether your agent will be accepted, the starting kit provides the exact
    evaluation script we will use to evaluate your agent, and instructions on how to use
    this evaluation script. If your agent successfully runs in the evaluation script, it
    will have met all the requirements of a valid submission.
</p>

<p>
    The evaluation scenarios for both Track 1 and Track 2 were created using the
    provided maps, and thus, will be similar to the training scenarios that you create
    for your agent. See the evaluation section for more details.
